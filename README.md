    Goals/needs:
    An easy-to-use job application app.
    Needs to speed up the process of applying for jobs
    An easier way to track previously applied jobs.

    Problems/Frustrations:
    The job application process is too slow for how many jobs you get rejected by.
    Companies ask too many questions to get instantly rejected by them.
    It feels like I am filling in the same information on repeat.
