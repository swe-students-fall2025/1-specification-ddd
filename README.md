## Stakeholders

See instructions. Delete this line and replace with the name(s) of the stakeholder(s) you interviewed and lists showing their goals/needs, and problems/frustrations.

Georgia McNevin - Trinity College Dublin Student

    Goals/needs:
    An easy-to-use job application app.
    Needs to speed up the process of applying for jobs
    An easier way to track previously applied jobs.

    Problems/Frustrations:
    The job application process is too slow for how many jobs you get rejected by.
    Companies ask too many questions to get instantly rejected by them.
    It feels like I am filling in the same information on repeat.

Richard Yuan - NYU Student

    Goals/needs:
    A quick and easy way to apply for jobs/internships
    Find relevant openings and keep updated on new listings

    Problems/Frustration:
    For non cs students, there's not really a github repo with latest jobs
    Often times, short answer questions are tedious as same content just slightly edited per company, a tool to speed this up would be nice.


## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to simplify and accelerate the job search process for college students and entry-level professionals by making applications as quick, personalized, and engaging as swiping.
